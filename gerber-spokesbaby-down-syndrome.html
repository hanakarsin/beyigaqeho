Business Insider <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> that the company has been slammed for being opportunistic in using Lucas as a face for their brand, because their life insurance company, Gerber Life, has allegedly denied coverage to babies born with Down Syndrome. A number of people have tweeted about their experience of being denied coverage:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@GerberLife</a> I am a bit perplexed and may be in need of some explanation. Nine years ago our family..my son...was denied Gerber life because he has Down Syndrome. Now a child with Down Syndrome is recognized as the new Gerber face. So has your policy changed as well?

It would now be awesome to see Gerber Life provide life insurance to babies with Ds. When Shane and Wyatt were born they were denied life insurance because they were born with Down syndrome</p>— Eric Waksmunski (@Ericwaxy) <a href=#>February 7, 2018</a></figure><p>According to Business Insider, Gerber Life is a "financially separate affiliate" from Gerber, though the two have almost identical branding and are clearly linked in people's minds. They denied in an email that they categorically refuse to cover children with Down Syndrome, saying they review these children on a case by case basis.&nbsp;</p><p>But many parents say they were denied or told to reapply after the child turned five.</p><p>It's an interesting conversation to have during a time when many companies are making gestures towards inclusion. But consumers want more than gestures, they want real change. If you are going to use children with Down Syndrome to send a message about inclusion, consider how you can prioritize their health and wellbeing in a real way.</p><p>But none of that rests on Lucas's shoulders. It's also hard to know what responsibility his parents have to speak to the issue. They possibly can't, if they've signed a contract with Gerber. Their primary focus seems to be Lucas and encouraging him in life.</p><p>Jason told Good Housekeeping, "When he grows up and we can teach him and show him all he did over the next year, I hope that it gives him confidence. He can do anything he wants."</p><p>And perhaps Lucas's case will bring attention to more than representation in media, but to real issues effecting the life and care for children with Down Syndrome everywhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYW18cX6OaW9oaXV4g4OvjqCcq5qVp3q0vM6knKyakZfGbrDOsKVmq6mjsbO7zJ4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgerber-spokesbaby-down-syndrome.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgerber-spokesbaby-down-syndrome.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgerber-spokesbaby-down-syndrome.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgerber-spokesbaby-down-syndrome.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgerber-spokesbaby-down-syndrome.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgerber-spokesbaby-down-syndrome.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./muslim-muslim-ticket-were-discussing-with-pdp-nnpp-labour-party-ex-sgf-babachir-lawal.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./muslim-muslim-ticket-were-discussing-with-pdp-nnpp-labour-party-ex-sgf-babachir-lawal.html>Muslim-Muslim Ticket: Were Discussing With PDP, NNPP, Labour Party</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./davis-cleveland-html.html>Davis Cleveland - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./davis-cleveland-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
