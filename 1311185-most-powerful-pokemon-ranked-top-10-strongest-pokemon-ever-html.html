With this growth, one may wonder which are the most powerful Pokemon.

However, everyone has their favorite. What is the strongest Pokemon of all time? Check out the list below to see if any of those you consider the best Pokémon comes out on top!</p><h2>10 of the most powerful Pokemon</h2><p class=align-left>Who is the strongest Pokemon of all time? Well, it may be difficult to know which Pokemon is the strongest because it depends on a number of things, including stats, types, moves, and abilities. To make up the top 10 list, the following attempt helps narrow down the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">best Pokemon </a>around. They include:</p><h3>10. The Original Dragon: A Powerful Fusion</h3><p class=align-left>Ranking 10 on the list of the most powerful is the 'Original Dragon.' The original dragon was the only fusion of Zekrom, Kyurem, and Reshiram. The three original legendary parts are strong enough on their own, but when fused, their combined power brings their level to over 9000.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f0b0555d5a293c52.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 ridiculously cute pokemon of all time across all generations</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Take note that this Pokémon is one of the strongest ever. It was responsible for the creation of the Unova Kingdom.</p><h3>9. Regigigas: The Continental Titan!</h3><p class=align-left>Regigigas is a Legendary Pokémon that all followers and lovers of Pokemon need no introduction to. It is a legendary Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. He is well-known to have pulled the continents through the oceans. This is one of the major displays of power that make him stand out.</p><p class=align-left>Further proving himself, he displayed his power even as Kyorge and Groudon, two other known Legendaries guarded the land and sea.</p><h3>8. Lunala and Solgaleo: Different but powerful</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f0b0555d5a293c52.jpg><p class=align-left>Solgaleo is the sun god, and he gives the title a deep meaning. Lunala, on the other hand, is also equally strong. The two Pokémon represent the two shiniest objects in the sky. They are known to have signature Z-Powers that make them stand out as strong, even stronger than most legendaries ever recorded.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6b69a8c5c6a4a6a4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Animals of the Red Book of Kazakhstan: a comprehensive list</span></p></a><h3>7. Ultra Necrozma: A Legendary Combination</h3><p class=align-left>With what you know about Solgaleo and Lunala, it is easy to see how Ultra Necrozma made the list of the best. Ultra Necrozma can control and fuse with both of the legendary Pokémon to form one of the most powerful Pokemon on its own. You can consider him a superior Pokemon around.</p><h3>6. Mega Mewtwo X and Y: A Pokémon created to be the best</h3><p class=align-left>Although Mewtwo was artificially created to be the very best of the non-god Pokémon, his Mega form makes him even better. He may not be as strong as some of what you would consider as legendary Pokémon, as far as "regular" Pokémon go, he is the best. In fact, he is the highest base stat Pokemon.</p><h3>5. Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon: The God Pokémon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dfc6f0b538c0e3a4.jpg><p class=align-left>Halfway through the list of the best Pokemons is the God-tier Pokémon. Kyogre, the Lord of water, created the sea, while Groudon, the Lord of land, created the earth. The two are absolute powerhouses considering their heavy-duty roles and functions as far as the formation of the planet is concerned.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/af0bfe7b41ed170d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>KonMarie: a method for cleaning the house</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Their original forms make them even stronger; hence the natural position they assume on this list.</p><h3>4. Mega Rayquaza: Coolest Pokemon ever</h3><p class=align-left>You may consider this as a cool Pokemon, especially if you factor in the looks. He is the Lord of the Sky. He was created to stop the fights between the Pokémon of our last entry. This means that he has the power levels of both Kyogre and Groudon combined, making him one of the most powerful Pokemons ever.</p><h3>3. Giratina: The unstable one</h3><p class=align-left>While the first and second Pokemon may not have any controversies, and many will agree, Giratina comes third on the list. It is in the Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. It was created by Ken Sugimori, and the Giratina first appeared in the video games, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.</p><p class=align-left>It gained prominence in the sister game, Pokémon Platinum, which it was made the mascot of — choosing the Lord of Antimatter, Giratina, as the third most powerful Pokemon seems like an obvious choice.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e3ffa2bd4fd6a829.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>These funny Star Wars memes will make you laugh</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He controls antimatter and the Distortion World, which he was banished for being unstable. Despite the instability, he is still unbelievably strong.</p><h3>2. Dialga and Palkia: The Firstborns</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6b69a8c5c6a4a6a4.jpg><p class=align-left>Dialga and Palkia are the Lords of Time and Space. They were the firstborns of Arceus, alongside number three, Giratina. They are powerful just by virtue of their functions as they are in charge of managing the whole universe.</p><p class=align-left>When comparing the two with Giratina, the later is just too unstable. What's more, time and space will always be crucial even on the land. They both are equally important, hence they get to be ranked together.</p><p class=align-left>Dialga and Palkia are known in Japan as the legendary Pokemon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Palkia has been described to be totally awesome! It's like the first Pokemon in a movie to actually nearly destroy the whole main town, plus it's the guardian of space, which gives it epic status.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/06a1e18581050de4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover the best action anime films of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Dialga, on the other hand, is known for his adamant orb and roar of time. It can also beat any Pokemon in one move. It is considered very strong with 150 power.</p><h3>1. Arceus: The first and the Last</h3><p class=align-left>What is the most powerful Pokemon? Arceus is one Pokemon whose position is not debatable. The legendary Pokémon is from the Pókemon series. His first appearance was in the 18th Pokémon movie alongside other Legendary Pokemon.</p><p class=align-left>Arceus was the first Pokémon that ever existed, and he will probably be the last. He is a god. It is not surprising that it is the most powerful Pokemon of all time. It has the highest stats of all Pokemon.</p><p class=align-left>Who is the strongest Pokemon 2020? Even with the list of all-time Pokemon's above, Greninja has been ranked as the strongest Pokemon in 2020.</p><h2>Which is the best Legendary Pokemon?</h2><p class=align-left>The best Legendary Pokemon is Mewtwo. Mewtwo is the only Legendary with two Mega Evolutions, both of which are quite powerful in the right scenario.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dedc01f3354c002b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Viking symbols and signs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Mewtwo has long been an absolute beast on the battlefield with a versatile move pool able to be unleashed to great effect thanks to its high speed and even higher special attack.</p><h2>Which is the strongest Legendary Pokemon?</h2><p class=align-left>This has to be Deoxys. Deoxys' speed form has the highest speed stat in the game. Anyone who knows how to properly utilize Deoxys will be extremely rewarded in battle.</p><h2>Which is the best non Legendary Pokemon?</h2><p class=align-left>According to Pokemon stats, Ditto is the best <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">non Legendary Pokemon</a>. Ditto copies the opponent’s stats (and all stat boosts) automatically now, thanks to the Imposter Ability. With a Choice Scarf, it can also outspeed just about everything to boot. It’s not a Legendary Pokémon, but at the same time, it can be any Legendary Pokémon. Its HP and PP suffer, but work around those shortcomings and you’ve got potentially the strongest and most versatile Pokémon ever created on your hands.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3a4f76ff7fd3fbc7.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ghostbusters: Afterlife: All the interesting news about the anticipated movie</span></p></a><h2>Which is the best Normal Type Pokemon?</h2><p class=align-left>This title goes to Slaking. Slaking has the highest base stats of any non-legendary and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">non-Mega Pokémon</a>, making it more powerful than famously powerful choices for a team like Garchomp, Dragonite, and Arcanine. Slaking also has the highest Attack base stat of any Normal Type Pokemon. As if that wasn't enough, Slaking's signature move, Slack Off, heals half of its HP. Slaking is the perfect Pokémon.</p><p class=align-left>This list of the 10 most powerful Pokemon are examples of the best you can find. While there are many Pokemon out here, the most powerful depends on several things. All factors considered, the list above has some of those we believe are worthy. You should, however, note that the ranking is likely to change based on personal preferences and how fans vote. What do you think about our list? Did your favorite Pokemon make it to the list?
