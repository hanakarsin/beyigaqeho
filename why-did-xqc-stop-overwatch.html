As long as you're willing to stream consistently and invest that time, there's a good chance you'll get a following and maybe even make a decent living off of the streaming platform.</p><p>Certain e-personalities become synonymous with the titles/genres of games that they play. When you watch Maximilian Dood, you're probably in for some great Capcom fighting games. When you watch Ninja, then you're in for some <a href=#>Fortnite</a> action. And for many Twitch viewers, xQc was who they turned to when they wanted to see some <a href=#>Overwatch</a> action. So why did he stop playing the game?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did xQc stop 'Overwatch'?</h2><p>The streamer, whose real name is Felix Lengyel, played a lot of Overwatch on Twitch. He mained Winston in the game and created plenty of content off of his streaming sessions, from bitter rage smash cuts to legitimately funny in-game moments.</p><p>So it was strange to see him, seemingly all of a sudden, cut down his time playing Overwatch to then not playing it ever on Twitch. xQc's fanbase was understandably perplexed, and people began speculating as to why he decided to call it quits. The prevailing presumption? That he had grown tired of Overwatch.</p><p>It seems crazy that a live streamer would give up playing a game that's certainly contributing to their bank account, but that's essentially why xQc stopped playing it. Seriously.</p><p>While he really enjoys playing the game competitively, after his stream became really popular, most of the players involved knew that they were playing against him, so folks just tried to do "interesting" things to try and gain attention in the stream.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait, wasn‚Äôt xQC on an Overwatch team at some point? I might be wrong though.</p>‚Äî Calicocat (@deadkandy) <a href=#>August 2, 2021</a></figure><p>While the best way to gain recognition at something is to honestly try your hardest to win the match, xQc became jaded by all of the people essentially saying, "Look at me! Look at how interesting I am!" in an attempt to entertain whoever was watching the stream.</p><p>During a live stream, xQc answered a fan's question pertaining to his decision to stop streaming Overwatch games: "The problem that I have with the game is that it‚Äôs almost like ‚Ä¶ when I stream the game, the stream becomes like a marketplace for attention. Every game ‚Ä¶ people come in on my team, and everybody just fishes for attention. On my team and the enemy team."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You do realise xqc has had experience with esports in overwatch granted it was winston and Rien witch is more game sense and timing than aim but still</p>‚Äî *insert funny and relevant name here pls* (@DanielVenters5) <a href=#>August 3, 2021</a></figure><p>He continued, "I can‚Äôt play even the game properly. It‚Äôs just not fun. Like, I can‚Äôt play the actual game. It‚Äôs not competitive. Why bother playing a competitive game all-in when it‚Äôs just not competitive?"</p><p>So xQc really decided to stop for the love of the game.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">xQc quit streaming gambling games for a completely different reason, however.</h2><p>The Canadian streamer became a paid sponsor for a gambling site and 2,000 users signed up to the service using his promo code. However, he decided to stop that line of work after noticing he became "slightly, if not moderately addicted" to gambling and didn't want to enable any more of his own followers to do the same.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I only know xqc cause of Overwatch</p>‚Äî PettySatire üèÅüêç (@BluSatire) <a href=#>August 5, 2021</a></figure><p>Do you think that gambling "is content" like xQc said?
