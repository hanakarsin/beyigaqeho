MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, began his YouTube channel when he was 13 years old. In 2012, he uploaded his first video to the platform, showing off his then-amateur gaming skills. MrBeast has since gained over 163 million subscribers on his channel, which now includes stunt videos, giveaways, and his popular vlog.</p><p>And while MrBeast has amassed a loyal fanbase, his journey to internet fame has included a fair share of controversy. In January, the Wichita native shared a video documenting his efforts to cure 1,000 people of blindness. The video prompted backlash from viewers online, with some suggesting the content was ‚Äúdemonic,‚Äù per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>. MrBeast responded to the backlash and explained that he was simply fulfilling his promise to ‚Äúhelp people.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The criticism was not enough to stop MrBeast, from continuing his philanthropic mission. On May 6, the YouTuber uploaded a video that shows him helping 1,000 deaf people here for the first time. Like his other creations, the video has amassed millions of views with fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">praising</a> MrBeast for his work.</p><p>Now, it appears that MrBeast has taken some time to work on himself, and fans are loving his physical transformation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">MrBeast achieved weight loss by changing his lifestyle and starting to working out!</h2><p>MrBeast is getting real about his struggle with weight and has revealed that he is taking major steps to change his lifestyle. On June 29, the YouTuber took to Twitter to share an update on his fitness journey with his 21 million followers. ‚ÄúWoke up and realized I was obese, so I started lifting and walking 12,500 steps a day,‚Äù he wrote alongside a shirtless image of himself. ‚ÄúStill got a long way to being yoked but I‚Äôm happy with my progress so far.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Woke up and realized I was obese so I started lifting and walking 12,500 steps a day.

He explained on Twitter that he was over 40% body fat but has since cut that number in half. In addition to his intense cardio regime, MrBeast works out with a trainer, has changed his diet, and is committed to getting more sleep.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans are praising MrBeast for his new look.</h2><p>Fans of MrBeast rushed to congratulate the internet personality on his shocking transformation. ‚ÄúCongrats Mr! Looks like you found your inner beast,‚Äù <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan replied</a>. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another suggested</a> that the content creator needed to work on his pecs. MrBeast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> to the fan and jokingly explained that the first step was to ‚Äúnot be fat.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/MrBeast</a></figure><p>It‚Äôs clear that MrBeast is focused on making healthier lifestyle choices, but that has not stopped him from creating thrilling content. In December he uploaded a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vlog</a> from his time in Antarctica. In the 12-minute clip, the YouTuber and his friends hiked a snow-covered mountain, prepared their own food, and even carved out a cave in the snow. MrBeast also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid an assassin</a> to kill him and uploaded the entire experience on his YouTube channel. The assassin was clearly unsuccessful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfor%2BjscCsq2avlZ60qcCMpaasqw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmrbeast-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmrbeast-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmrbeast-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmrbeast-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmrbeast-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmrbeast-weight-loss.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bryan-le-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bryan-le-html.html>RiceGum - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chosen-jacobs-html.html>Chosen Jacobs - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chosen-jacobs-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
