However, the misery of the past few days have blown up the strident rebuttal in the faces of the country’s officials.

Akeredolu over his statement on the 2023 presidency which he insisted must be zoned to the south as the region won’t support any northern candidate or the party that fields a northerner.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong>&nbsp;had reported that the Ondo State Governor and Chairman of the Southern Governors’ Forum, Rotimi Akeredolu declared that&nbsp;<strong>any political party</strong>&nbsp;that fields a northern candidate in the 2023 presidential election will lose.</p><p>Two factions of the&nbsp;National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW)&nbsp;on Friday morning clashed at the Agbado area of the Alimosho Local Government Area in Lagos State.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports that this caused pandemonium amongst residents of the area.</p><p>It was gathered that road users and passersby scampered for safety when the two factions violently engaged each other</p><p>An eyewitness told The PUNCH that gunshots were also heard during the conflict over ticket collection at the parks.</p><p>The presidency has declared that the Boko Haram terrorist group had almost taken over the entire country spreading destruction everywhere before President Muhammadu Buhari became Nigeria’s leader in 2015.</p><p>The presidency however submitted that Buhari turned things around after coming into power.</p><p>The special adviser to the president on media and publicity, Femi Adesina made this submission in the latest of his weekly articles titled ‘Zulum zooms in’ which was released on Thursday.</p><p>The Department of State Service (DSS) has again refused the leader of the&nbsp;Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu,&nbsp; a change a cloth despite a court order.</p><p>Recall that Justice Binta Nyako had on January 18,2022, ordered the DSS to allow the IPOB leader change his clothe before the next trial date.</p><p>But Nnamdi Kanu returned to the Federal High Court,&nbsp;Abuja, on the 19th with the same outfit, prompting and enquiry by the trial judge.</p><p>Counsel to the DSS,&nbsp; Labaran had claimed that the pro-Biafra activist had refused to change his clothes but he was swiftly countered by Nnamdi Kanu’s lead counsel, Mike Ozekhome, who stated that his team could not get the IPOB leader new cloths at short notice.</p><p>Nigeria’s main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has postponed it’s North-West Zonal Congress earlier scheduled for Saturday, February 12, 2022.</p><p>In a terse statement released on Friday (today) the party’s National Working Committee said a new date will be made public in due course.</p><p>Naija News observed that the party did not state the reason for the postponement of the congress.</p><p>The Senator representing Ekiti Central in the National Assembly, Opeyemi Bamidele, has suspended his plan to dump the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p>In a statement he personally signed on Friday, Bamidele also said he has shelved the plan to drag the ruling party to court&nbsp;over the conduct of its primary election in the state.</p><p>The former Lagos Commissioner reiterated that the primary election that produced Biodun Oyebanji as the party’s flag bearer in the upcoming governorship election is “a fraudulent and fictitious vote count”</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
