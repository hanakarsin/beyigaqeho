During a recent <a href=#>WWE</a> match against Ridge Holland, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ilja Dragunov</a> appeared to leave the ring with a serious injury.</p><p>Following Ilja's dramatic departure, many wrestling fans wanted to know exactly what happened to him and whether or not he got hurt. Wrestling can often involve some pretty impressive acting, but many fans also know that getting injured can be a real problem for wrestlers. They put their bodies on the line every time they enter the ring.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Ilja Dragunov?</h2><p>Ilja appeared to be hurt after Ridge attempted a brain-buster move on him. Ilja landed head-first on the canvas, and the match stopped so that he could get medical attention.</p><p>According to reports, the injury wasn't real. Instead, it was just an impressive piece of acting on Ilja's part. The match was pre-taped earlier in December and Ilja's injury was all part of the plan.</p><p>According to reporting from Fightful, Ilja's injury was "good acting," but fans definitely shouldn't go after Ridge Holland over the injury. It was all staged from the start, right down to Ilja's inability to respond to the ref's call and the stretcher that wheeled him out of the arena. It's certainly possible for wrestlers to get hurt, but in this case, that doesn't seem to be what happened.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ilja is scheduled to defend his title in just two weeks.</h2><p>It seems like this injury story may all be part of a broader redemption arc that Ilja is being set up for. The NXT champion is set to defend his title on New Year's Day when he takes on NXT North American Champion Trick Williams. Trick earned his spot in the ring after winning the 2023 Menâ€™s Iron Survivor Challenge. If Ilja was injured, there would likely be some news about his inability to participate in that match.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Ilja is widely considered to be one of the most talented fighters to ever step foot in a WWE ring, and based on his ability to convincingly fake an injury, it seems like he's also a pretty good actor on top of that. It isn't clear what his future will be in the league, but it seems likely that he'll be back to compete in just a few short weeks. He may start the fight in a cast, but it seems unlikely that he'll end it in one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSipJqWeqW%2BwKCsp6em</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-ilja-dragunov.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-ilja-dragunov.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-ilja-dragunov.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-ilja-dragunov.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-ilja-dragunov.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-ilja-dragunov.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marvel-mcu-characters-as-birds.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marvel-mcu-characters-as-birds.html>Someone Made a Thread of Marvel Characters as Birds and It's Perfect</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./343261-how-a-liquor-licence-kenya-html.html>How to get a liquor licence in Kenya</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./343261-how-a-liquor-licence-kenya-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
