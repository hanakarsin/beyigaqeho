We're still waiting to see what’s going on and what’s going to happen."</p><p>As for what La La wants to see from her character, she admitted that it was nice to play someone so different from her Power character, Lakeisha.&nbsp;</p><p>"I love that I was able to go from just two really different characters. People really love Dom, and that's incredible. I would just like to continue to see that character grow, and to see people get more in tune with her life and background over time.
