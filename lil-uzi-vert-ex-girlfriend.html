Despite their back and forth drama on social media a few months ago, the two seem very much in love and frequently post adorable photos of one another on the app.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Lil Uzi and JT appear to be solid, his ex-girlfriend has been seemingly throwing major shade via social media. And the result has turned into a back and forth verbal war on Twitter between JT and his former girlfriend. With all the drama circulating on Twitter, fans are interested in learning more about Lil Uzi’s ex-girlfriend.</p><p>Who is Lil Uzi’s ex-girlfriend? Read on to get the lowdown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lil Uzi Vert’s ex-girlfriend Brittany Byrd is an artist and curator.</h2><p>It’s true that Lil Uzi Vert has only been public with a few relationships in the past. While Brittany may be a mystery to some fans, she is actually the last woman Uzi was in a serious relationship with before committing to JT.</p><p>According to Brittany’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram bio</u></a>, she works as an artist and a curator. She actually owns the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Byrd Museum</u></a>, which is an online site that features a variety of artistic pieces ranging from paintings to furniture.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Brittany and Lil Uzi were together for years. The pair would often be seen pictured together and hanging out with one another. While many fans believed that they were a perfect match, since their style and personalities seemed to be a perfect match, things were not set in stone. The pair ended their relationship in 2016.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brittany and JT’s feud came to verbal blows online after Brittany commented on their magazine cover.</h2><p>One thing about JT is that she has no problem verbally sparring with anyone who she feels disrespects her. While most celebrities allow certain things said on social media to slide, JT always stands up for herself. And the issue with Brittany serves as proof.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When Brittany posted a tweet with a sock emoji and followed up by "LMFAO" on her Twitter account, JT and fans alike felt like this was mocking their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">magazine cover images</a> that were leaked. People believed that she used the sock emoji to insinuate that Lil Uzi stuffed his underwear for the shoot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>JT then took to Twitter to drag Brittany in a series of now-deleted tweets. The “Flewed Out” rapper called Brittany an “animated grasshopper,” and said that Brittany wishes “she could be in her shoes.”</p><p>Fans quickly tweeted at JT telling her that the situation is not worth addressing, but JT wouldn’t let the issue go. She even explained that Brittany has been sneak-dissing her for quite some time and that she’s had enough.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If I wanted ppl to like me I wouldn’t speak my mind.</p>— JT (@ThegirlJT) <a href=#>May 7, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Making matters worse, Brittany then shared a video on her Instagram stories and made some very damaging accusations about JT and Lil Uzi Vert's relationship. In the video, she spoke about JT being a domestic violence victim and urged her female followers to “never give their whole life" to a partner.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I offer this to every young girl, every woman or young person following me to never give your whole life to a man, never let a man use you to attack another woman, don't allow yourself to be abused, confused, misused enough to become an abuser,” Brittany shared. “I'm too much of a womanist, I am too much of a feminist to ever allow myself to hate you."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She continued, "You can call me homeless, but I saw you get three-pieced like a person in a Mayweather fight and asking for a hotel room and a safe environment and it just didn't make me feel good to see that, it made me feel sorry for the girls who think that abuse is OK."&nbsp;</p><p>And of course, JT blew a gasket and flooded Twitter and her Instagram stories with criticism of Brittany and her claims.</p><p>"I never saw that sick a-- b---h a day of my life,” JT said on her Instagram story. She also took things a step further by sharing the national toll-free line for unhoused people after accusing Brittany of being homeless.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>JT continued to tweet her feelings as she responded to fans. It also rubbed fans the wrong way that Lil Uzi Vert has been mum about the entire situation.</p><p>However, Lil Uzi is known to get into social media spats too, so there is a chance that Uzi may make a statement when ready.</p><p>It seems as if things have died down for now, since JT has deleted many of her tweets. But there is no telling if the two ladies will verbally attack each other in the future.&nbsp;JT has proven that any subliminal posts or direct shots will quickly start beef, so anything is possible. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobatedSzoGaulafBbrHXZp6iqpybv6qxzZ0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flil-uzi-vert-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flil-uzi-vert-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flil-uzi-vert-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flil-uzi-vert-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flil-uzi-vert-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flil-uzi-vert-ex-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./woman-reveals-high-paying-healthcare-jobs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./woman-reveals-high-paying-healthcare-jobs.html>Woman Reveals How She Landed High-Paying Healthcare Jobs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./transfer-vlahovic-takes-ronaldos-shirt-at-juventus.html>Vlahovic Takes Ronaldos Shirt At Juventus</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./transfer-vlahovic-takes-ronaldos-shirt-at-juventus.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
