If you're a <a href=#>millennial</a>, then you probably thought of Harry Potter. If you're <a href=#>Gen Z</a>, then you probably thought of Scar Girl.</p><p>For those of you who need a little help keeping up with the kids these days, Scar Girl is a <a href=#>TikTok</a> creator (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@wtmab</a>) named Annie. She's a stunning girl who just so happens to have a large scar on her face. Or does she? Because a lot of TikTok seems to think that the scar is fake.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Scar Girl on TikTok?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@wtmab href=#>@wtmab</a><p>Issuing a threat on social media is a federal crime</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - molly ü§†ü§°" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - molly ü§†ü§°</a></figure><p>Scar Girl, also known as Annie, is a TikTok creator that tends to post lip sync videos. Annie is known for having a scar on her face, however people seem to think that it actually isn't real.</p><p>Many people commenting are joking about how committed Annie is to the "bit," as well as telling her to go get her money. There are also a lot of comments on how the scar changes location and sizes hence the suspicion around the validity of the scar.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@wtmab</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Scar Girl's scar fake?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@livelaughwhor3 href=#>@livelaughwhor3</a><p>scars don‚Äôt change angles scar girl <a title=scargirl href=#>#scargirl</a> <a title=scarfacegirl href=#>#scarfacegirl</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Cricket Sound - Sound Effects" href=#>‚ô¨ Cricket Sound - Sound Effects</a></figure><p>One TikTok sleuth took old footage of Annie's scar when it first happened vs. what it looks like now, and it does look quite different. But sometimes things scab over very dark brown so we didn't find this too alarming. However, the angle of the scar is what seems most sus here.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@wtmab href=#>@wtmab</a><p>Felt like it was time tbh</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - ‚ÄºÔ∏èA N N I E‚ÄºÔ∏è" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - ‚ÄºÔ∏èA N N I E‚ÄºÔ∏è</a></figure><p>Annie actually took to TikTok herself to explain what happened. In the video above, she says that the difference in size is because she actually has two scars. The first is from when the originally injury happened (we were not able to find an explainer video for this). The second supposedly occurred when she applied topical cream that ended up burning her face, creating an even bigger scar. Annie also said that her body has always taken long to heal, which is why the scar is still as visible as it is.</p><p>In the video, Annie uses makeup wipes to try to wipe the scar off, showing that nothing comes off her skin.</p><p>However, even that video didn't appear to work as there are tons of comments such as, "Why are you gaslighting me?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@wtmab href=#>@wtmab</a><p>hey guys, originally in March of 2020 when I was injured and realized that this would be a permanent mark on my face forever I was embarrassed. I was so upset that I thought my face was ruined as insecure as I was already at 15 navigating highschool. I felt like the opportunity to look at myself in the mirror and smile was taken away from me because of a cruel situation. It was until one day that I realized that covering my scar and openly hating it was a disservice to those close to me and myself suffering from insecurities. While I decided not to cover it for those reasons it never fully went away and neither did my insecurities because when I looked in the mirror I saw the reason behind why it was there. Unfortunately I had a poor reaction to the first topical I tried in an attempt to fade it. I was sloppy applying it as well and this led to a longer injury. I was in a dark place knowing that it was now even worse. I had to wait til that fully healed to start a second treatment which I began in august. Since then, this treatment has been super invasive and I cannot emphasize the pain directed around that injury. It‚Äôs at a point where it genuinely does look gross, it has risen and it‚Äôs scabbed over. I also did not think about how tanner would get in the scabbed area when I did it. It should get better with time but unfortunately all of my scars do still heal brown. While I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right that people mindlessly comment hate for whatever reason it is, I do make a decision to put myself out on the internet. My account was made to show those out there, they‚Äôre more than their scars. Not to have a comment section showing those same people they should hate themselves because of their scars. I‚Äôll never stop using my platform for DV awareness and body positivity. I hope this video is what y‚Äôall need to move on or at least understand. No one should make a comment on someone‚Äôs scars, especially not knowing the history behind that scar or the person on the screen. If anyone ever needs to talk my dms are open, I would love to listen to your stories and hype y‚Äôall up. I promise I hear u and I see u. Thank you and I hope y‚Äôall will move with grace in the future.</p><a title="‚ô¨ MEAN! (Remix) [with Noah Kahan] - Madeline The Person" href=#>‚ô¨ MEAN! (Remix) [with Noah Kahan] - Madeline The Person</a></figure><p>Annie posted another video of herself attempting to wipe off her scar to no avail. A condensed version of her caption reads:</p><p>"Originally in March of 2020, when I was injured and realized that this would be a permanent mark on my face forever, I was embarrassed... It was until one day that I realized that covering my scar and openly hating it was a disservice to those close to me and myself suffering from insecurities...

I‚Äôll never stop using my platform for DV awareness and body positivity. I hope this video is what y‚Äôall need to move on or at least understand."</p><p>We agree, Annie, we think the internet needs to move on. If the scar is fake and this has all been a ploy for attention, then so what? Clearly it worked. Annie can go unpack her reasoning for faking it with her therapist, not with the haters in her comments.</p><p>And if the scar is real (which, unpopular opinion, but we believe that it is), then all of these people are just making it harder on a poor girl who's already having to navigate society's unreachable standards for women.</p><p>Either way, let's send her healing vibes (both for her inner and outer self) and let's move the f--k on. OK, we're stepping off our soapbox now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLCivoygoKukXam2rMDOpA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fscar-girl-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fscar-girl-tiktok.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fscar-girl-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fscar-girl-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscar-girl-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscar-girl-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jackson-mahomes-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jackson-mahomes-html.html>Jackson Mahomes - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./300431-arabuko-sokoke-forest-fire-inferno-unknown-html.html>Arabuko-Sokoke forest on fire, cause of inferno unknown</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./300431-arabuko-sokoke-forest-fire-inferno-unknown-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
