Farouk Ahmed broke the news at the launch of the headquarters of “Decade of Gas,” in Abuja.</p><p>According to Ahmed, the authority has already engaged the relevant stakeholders like the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC).</p><p>He added that NMDPRA has also consulted the commercial sector that have all aligned with the new pricing template.</p><p>The former Governor of Oyo State, Chief Rashidi Ladoja, has dragged the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Lekan Balogun and Governor Seyi Makinde over the chieftaincy review.</p><p>Ladoja, who is the Otun Olubadan of Ibadan, also dragged the ten newly elevated beaded crown-wearing Kings before the Oyo State High Court.</p><p>Recall that Makinde, on June 22, approved the elevation following the recommendation of Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, who is the prescribed and consenting authority.</p><p>Following the approval, the governor last Friday presented the Staff of Office to the new Obas, while Ladoja, who had earlier rejected the elevation was conspicuously absent at the ceremony.</p><p>The National Vice Chairman (North West) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Salihu Lukman, has accused the party’s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, of mobilising resentment against the choice of the leadership of the National Assembly.</p><p>Lukman said the party chairman refused to abide by the decision to the choices of Godswill Akpabio and Tajudeen Abbas as the Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives respectively.</p><p>The APC chieftain added that Adamu never campaigned for the party’s adopted candidates for the Senate Presidency and Speakership positions and kept distancing himself from the position of the party.</p><p>He said rather than developing guidelines as directed by the party’s constitution that would guide the emergence of the leadership of the National Assembly, the Adamu-led NWC approached it with a blank cheque.</p><p>The Chief of Army Staff, Maj.-Gen. Taoreed Lagbaja has asked state governors to allow the army wipe out the terrorists and other criminal elements operating in the northwest and other regions of the country.</p><p>The military chief made the request on Wednesday during his meeting with the Zamfara State Governor, Dauda Lawal.</p><p>Lagbaja also ruled out the possibility of giving any further amnesty to the criminals.</p><p>He added that as they are being chased out of the northwest, the criminals won’t be allowed to enter any other part of the country.</p><p>He added that the criminals should flee the country with immediate effect, saying they would be given close marking and blocked from entering other parts of the country.</p><p>The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu has declared that he shouldn’t be condemned for supporting now-former Senate President Ahmad Lawan as his preferred candidate for the party’s 2023 presidential ticket.</p><p>According to Adamu, he has every right to support any candidate of his choice for elective positions which is the beauty of democracy.</p><p>The APC National Chairman however added after President Bola Tinubu emerged victorious at the party’s presidential primary election, he worked totally to ensure his victory at the polls.</p><p>Adamu added that rather than commend him for leading the party to victory in the elections, some people are busy calling him out for his stand in the run-up to the party’s presidential primaries.</p><p>Making further clarifications, the APC Chairman disclosed that the relationship between himself and President Tinubu is smooth and cordial as any report of a fight is mere speculation.</p><p>On his reported position on the emergence of principal officers for the majority party in the National Assembly, Adamu said he was quoted out of context as he had no issues with the persons who emerged but with the manner the communication was handled by the lawmakers.</p><p>Also, he denied suppressing anyone from airing his/her views at APC national meetings, explaining that Saliu Lukman, for instance, who has always accused him of running a one-man show, has always attended those meetings.</p><p>According to him, the media is always trying to explore the sensational side of issues.</p><h2>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
