His position and allegiance to his party is self-defining and does not need any qualification by us.”</p><h2>We Are Proud To Be Associated With Him</h2><p>The APC statement added that the party is proud to be associated with Nnamani and won’t care too much about providing further explanation regarding his role.</p><p>It said;&nbsp;“Any explanation as to his status should be coming from the other party and not from us who are very proud to be associated with him.”</p><h2>We Will Add Other Names</h2><p>The party stated that other people will be added to the presidential campaign list which already has over 400 names.</p><p>“The Presidential Campaign Council of the All Progressives Congress hereby clarifies that the list of members of the campaign council released at the weekend, is a partial list.</p><p>“It contains only the directors, deputy directors, secretaries of directorates and key stakeholders.</p><p>“The council also assures our esteemed governors that the secretariat of the council has not jettisoned the names submitted by them,” Onanuga said.</p><h2>Contradictory Statement</h2><p>Earlier, the All Progressives Congress, Presidential Campaign Council, (APCPCC), clarified that the name of the former Governor of Enugu State, <strong>Sen. Chimaroke Nnamani</strong> which appeared on the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council was an error.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that the serving lawmaker’s name appeared in a list released on Friday, where he was listed as one of the members of the Local Government Directorate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council.</p><p>Chimaroke’s name appeared barely a month ago, after the former governor of Enugu state was praising the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu, for his sagacity and style of politics extolling his status as a performer.</p><p>Speaking on <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>the development</a></strong>, the spokesman of the APC presidential campaign council, <strong>Bayo Onanuga</strong> on Saturday, said that the person intended to be added and represented by Chimaroke Nnamani, was the former Senate President, Ken Nnamani.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FvZmtoYmh6orzCZpqoppaev66%2FjKmbqWWjmruiwM6rZKemkaKur7WMoqpmr5%2BnuKq6xmadqKpdqbavwcGuZKmqlai2pbHNnLBo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2023-apc-confirms-pdp-senator-nnamani-is-working-for-tinubu-presidency.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2023-apc-confirms-pdp-senator-nnamani-is-working-for-tinubu-presidency.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2023-apc-confirms-pdp-senator-nnamani-is-working-for-tinubu-presidency.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2023-apc-confirms-pdp-senator-nnamani-is-working-for-tinubu-presidency.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2023-apc-confirms-pdp-senator-nnamani-is-working-for-tinubu-presidency.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2023-apc-confirms-pdp-senator-nnamani-is-working-for-tinubu-presidency.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./boko-haram-iswap-obeys-isis-order-reshuffles-leaders-full-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./boko-haram-iswap-obeys-isis-order-reshuffles-leaders-full-list.html>ISWAP Obeys ISIS' Order, Reshuffles Leaders [Full List]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./larry-rudolph-lori-milliron-now.html>Was Dentist Larry Rudolph Found Guilty of Murdering His Wife on a Tragic Safari Trip?
