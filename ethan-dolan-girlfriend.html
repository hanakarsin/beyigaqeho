The popular YouTuber finally confirmed that he is no longer single. Find out who captured the influencer's heart.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Sound the alarm! YouTuber <a href=#>Ethan Dolan</a> has officially confirmed that he's in a committed relationship. The YouTube star who is one half of the <a href=#>Dolan Twins</a> addressed the widely speculated assumption in a new video alongside his brother, which was posted on their channel on July 20.&nbsp;</p><p>In their new <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video titled </a>"Addressing assumptions about us..." the guys answer fans' questions. When one fan asked, "Is Ethan in a committed relationship?" he replied, "Yup." However, the influencer stayed mum on giving away any further details into his lovelife.&nbsp;</p><p>So, who is the girl that has captured Ethan's heart? Keep reading to find out more about <a href=#>who he is possibly dating</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Ethan Dolan’s rumored girlfriend?</h2><p>Last December, the <a href=#>Dolan Twins</a>’ fandom went nuts after footage surfaced on social media appearing to show the famous 20-year-old getting cozy on the beach with a pretty brunette. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The girl in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photos and videos</a>, which were taken by a fellow beachgoer, is believed to be Kristina Alice, an Australian influencer. The 22-year-old notably played Ethan’s love interest in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2018 music video</a> for Cub Sport’s "Hawaiian Party," which was directed by the Dolan brothers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>On one picture of the couple, the documenter wrote, "He just kissed the girl #exposed." When Ethan’s Instagram followers began questioning the validity of the images, the witness responded, "I sadly didn’t get the photo of them holding hands, but like trust me it was real."</p><p>The tipster added, "This was the only footage I got of them because I didn’t want to be rude."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ethan and Kristina’s Instagram Stories confirmed they were together.</h2><p>The duo seemingly put rumors to rest when they posted nearly identical pictures taken from a ridge overlooking the water. However, it now looks like Kristina has deleted her Instagram account so the only couple pictures we can look forward to seeing will have to come from Ethan.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Ethan previously admitted in a 2017 interview on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV’s TRL</a> that he’d be open to dating a fan. In fact, he prefers it! "I would want my girlfriend to be a fan of me ‘cause I would be a fan of whatever she was doing," he shared. And when it comes to finding actual dates, both he and his twin brother Grayson are doing just fine.&nbsp;</p><p>"We’ve been attracted to the same girl at first and then once one guy starts talking to her the other one sees her more as like a sister. Not attractive at all," Ethan noted in a past YouTube video. "There’s really no jealousy between us when it comes to girls."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ethan has been linked to fellow YouTuber Emma Chamberlain.&nbsp;</h2><p>For a long time, the aspiring actor’s subscribers were convinced he was hooking up with Emma given the pair’s obvious chemistry and frequent flirtations. Buzz surrounding these two really came to a head in January when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethan defended</a> the 19-year-old beauty on Twitter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>After a troll wrote, "emma chamberlain isn't relatable she's just got crusty lips and a horrible wardrobe and [a caffeine] addiction," Ethan replied, "Her lips deffffinitely aren’t crusty," leading followers to believe that the duo were more than just friends. However, Emma is now rumored to be dating TikTok star Aaron Hull.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, the content creator has expressed a desire to keep her romantic life private. "I don’t know if I would ever have a public relationship, ever. And this is not coming from experience in any way; this is coming from morals," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W Magazine</a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>"Breakups alone are absolutely the most f--king awful thing that exist. Why would you want other people to be heartbroken with you? I can’t imagine that," she added. "And also, I don’t like seeing other people’s relationships. It’s boring and it’s gross."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmsGprc1mm6ikkaN6qLXRpZ2roZWjsQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fethan-dolan-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fethan-dolan-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fethan-dolan-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fethan-dolan-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fethan-dolan-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fethan-dolan-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./i-was-suicidal-annie-idibia-cries-out-as-she-tenders-public-apology.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./i-was-suicidal-annie-idibia-cries-out-as-she-tenders-public-apology.html>'I Was Suicidal' - Annie Idibia Tenders Public Apology</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./was-alex-canceled-the-morning-show.html>Why Was Alex &amp;quot;Canceled&amp;quot; on The Morning Show'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./was-alex-canceled-the-morning-show.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
