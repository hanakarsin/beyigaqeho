Well, I say "stolen." This happened in 1999, well before the internet was the robust hate machine it is today. It was very easy to pretend to be someone else and it was impossible to rebuild the life and credit score stolen by a thief. The crook in question was a new friend from Germany who just needed a little help setting up her apartment. That help came in the form of my very American social security number. Hello it's me, a naive idiot!</p><p>Not only was she able to successfully turn on all utilities in her new pad, but my pal was also able to take out several credit cards in my name. I didn't have one myself and if anyone is going to decimate my credit, it better be me. Alas, it took years to fix and I never got a credit card because of it. So, I understand how Melody Rose feels as she details her battles with <a href=#>identity theft</a> in a series of rage-inducing <a href=#>TikToks</a>. Has someone checked Germany for this person?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Credit card thief</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This woman can't prove who she is with her own license.</h2><p>Melody, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@melodysrose</a> on TikTok, found herself in a horrifying pickle when she had to prove to Equifax that she wasn't responsible for some major purchases. When the consumer credit reporting agency asked Melody to send over a copy of her license, they <a href=#>didn't believe she was the same person in the photo</a>.</p><p>"This is your reminder to not be a bad b---- in your driver's license," says a tearful <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melody in her TikTok</a>. "Because when you have to confirm your identity to like Equifax or something ... they're gonna be like 'You're not who you say you are.'" Truthfully, Melody does look like a bad b----, and it's kind of victim blamey to suggest we all can't look like bad b------ in our license photos because scammers are gonna scam regardless.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@melodysrose href=#>@melodysrose</a><p>i am me!!!! ðŸ˜­</p><a title="â™¬ original sound - melody â™Šï¸Ž" href=#>â™¬ original sound - melody â™Šï¸Ž</a></figure><p>The main difference between 2023 Melody and the Melody in her license is, she's blond in her older photo. Other than that, these are clearly the same people. She was able to find the addresses used by the person who got credit cards in her name and of course, Melody has never been anywhere near these places. The issue now is, the cards cannot be removed from her credit report because Equifax cannot confirm her identify.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up TikTok</a>, Melody revealed that she googled one of the addresses and discovered it's stunning. "Supposedly I live in a place with floor-to-ceiling windows, and that's my view of downtown LA," she said, gesturing to a jaw-dropping view that is somehow sans smog.</p><p>Somehow Melody still has a sense of humor about the whole thing as she jokingly says she's gonna "plop myself down on my fancy couch in my fancy apartment." She finishes off by asking, "Do I look like I live here?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@melodysrose href=#>@melodysrose</a><p><a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a> are you calling me riiiiich???!?!?! <a title=socalscammer href=#>#socalscammer</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - melody â™Šï¸Ž" href=#>â™¬ original sound - melody â™Šï¸Ž</a></figure><p>Someone in the comments suggested Melody file a police report online, go to a social security office and put a pin on her number, and then check the Employment Development Department for her work history. Perhaps that will prove she never lived at either addresses listed on the credit cards?</p><p>In response to those suggestions, Melody filmed another TikTok. "First and foremost, great tips," she said. "I needed those tips ... about four or five years ago." Sadly this advice won't help Melody as the "stuff that this scammer got in my name has already been sent to collections." To make matters worse, she is also being sued for the $23,000 owed on the credit cards.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Even though that well-meaning person wasn't very helpful, others jumped into the replies to share similar stories they ended up fixing. "You can still do it," said one hopeful commenter. "This happened to me and I went through the identify theft steps through Identity Theft dot gov. I had to prove who I was and prove my address from the years the person took the apartment or whatever. It was a lot of documentation and it happened twice to me." Melody was already on top of that as well.</p><p>More than one person suggested she find a lawyer but obviously they can very pricey. For now, Melody has to wait until her court date in April 2024. She mentioned in the replies that the scammer was already in prison so at least they can't do any more damage. In the meantime, I'm lighting a candle for Melody who will definitely be a bad b---- again someday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqb%2BwwcGlnGabn6Ozqr7MoqWgZZmZsq%2FAyK2wZpyinsOmvtJmo6KblaPApnnPoaatpw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftrouble-confirming-identity-drivers-license-photo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftrouble-confirming-identity-drivers-license-photo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftrouble-confirming-identity-drivers-license-photo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftrouble-confirming-identity-drivers-license-photo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftrouble-confirming-identity-drivers-license-photo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftrouble-confirming-identity-drivers-license-photo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tiktokstar-13-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tiktokstar-13-html.html>13 Year Old TikTok Stars</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ohanaeze-joins-arewa-youths-to-call-for-bbnaija-ban.html>Ohanaeze Joins Arewa Youths To Call For #BBNaija Ban</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ohanaeze-joins-arewa-youths-to-call-for-bbnaija-ban.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
