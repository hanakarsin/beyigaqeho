If that's a trend train you're keen to jump on, you're in luck because Season 3 of <a href=#>Queer Eye</a> is about to <a href=#>arrive to Netflix tomorrow, March 15.</a></p><p>To say the show is a tear-jerky feel-good binge is a bit of an understatement, and many are wondering how they themselves can get in on some of the Fab Five fun. So how to you nominate someone for Queer Eye? Read on to find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how you can nominate your bestie for Queer Eye.</h2><p>If you want to catch the attention of the reboot's new Fab Five — <a href=#>Karamo Brown (culture)</a>, Antoni Powoski (food and wine), Tan France (fashion), Bobby Berk (design) and Jonathan Van Ness (grooming) — it's pretty simple.</p><p>But first you'll need to wait to see what city they're doing makeovers in, which the team will likely disclose later this spring. Season 3 takes place within an hour's radius of Kansas City, and last April, Netlix released a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">call on Twitter</a> urging hopefuls to email their name, contact info, photos and story to qecasting@itv.com.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Queer Eye casting directors reveal what the scouting process is like.</h2><p>Simply emailing the casting people doesn't guarantee you a spot on next season of Queer Eye. In fact, the casting process seems to be a process almost as complicated as actually making over participants' homes.</p><p>Queer Eye producers actually use a "twofold approach" when it comes to scouting their candidates. In an interview with Vanity Fair, casting "mastermind" Gretchen Palek opened up about the lengthy process.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>"We had casting people on the ground looking, scouting within the circumference of where we would be shooting," she explained. "Then we also had people in the office in New York working the phones, and also sort of scouring social."</p><p>"One of the things we're really proud of is we're really proactive," Gretchen continued. "We definitely accept applications and nominations, but we also know that sometimes the best stories may not submit themselves."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are the next steps if Queer Eye accepts your submission?</h2><p>Although the Queer Eye producers make it clear that submitters shouldn't hold their breaths waiting to be called, they do go into the next steps of the vetting process.</p><p>If you're close enough to their radius and they find your story compelling enough, you'll be asked to take them on a video tour throughout your home. "We'll say to them, 'Take us around your house, show us some of the problematic areas within your home'," Gretchen said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>It's during this tour that they'll figure out whether you and your spot is worthy enough. "'Show us your refrigerator, open up your cabinets, show us your closet'," Gretchen continued. "And that's when we know, 'OK, they could use us'."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">If your situation is especially desperate, you might be fast-tracked.</h2><p>Don't be embarrassed if your place is a disaster. The casting directors emphasize that they've seen nightmarish homes "but we don't judge." In fact, the more nightmarish, the better, in some cases.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Back in Season 1, Remington Porter's situation was so terrible (or ideal, depending on how you look at it) that he was fast-tracked. Remington had been living in his grandmother's 1970s-decorated home when he turned to the Fab Five for help.&nbsp;</p><p>"Certainly, once we saw that house we were like, 'Oh, we need to get Bobby in there, stat'," Gretchen confessed.&nbsp;</p><p>The casting directors also mentioned that nominators should check in with their nominees to make sure they're ready to undergo this huge change. If they "reach out to the person being nominated and they just don't seem ready," the team will move on to the next.</p><p>Don't miss the incredible makeovers this season will have to offer when Season 3 of Queer Eye is released on Netflix tomorrow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKennZ67osDEZqqopZWku6Z5xaipZqmlmrKzecSynA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-nominate-someone-for-queer-eye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-to-nominate-someone-for-queer-eye.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-nominate-someone-for-queer-eye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-to-nominate-someone-for-queer-eye.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-nominate-someone-for-queer-eye.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-nominate-someone-for-queer-eye.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1432451-hockey-player-mikayla-demaiters-biography-age-height-boyfriend-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1432451-hockey-player-mikayla-demaiters-biography-age-height-boyfriend-html.html>Hockey player Mikayla Demaiters biography: age, height, boyfriend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rita-moreno-relationship-history.html>Rita Morenos Relationship History</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rita-moreno-relationship-history.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
