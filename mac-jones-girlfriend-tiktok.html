Alabama recently added another national championship to its list of plaudits, and they were anchored by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac Jones</a>, the team's starting quarterback. Although Mac is currently a junior and will likely play another season, many football fans are already eager to learn more about him, including who his girlfriend is. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Mac Jones' girlfriend?</h2><p>Mac is currently dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie Scott</a>, a fellow Alabama student. Sophie is from St. Louis, Mo., and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started college</a> in 2017. She's a member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and dedicates many of her Instagram posts to that group. She also has a fairly prominent presence on <a href=#>TikTok</a>, although her most popular posts tend to feature Mac in some capacity.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Mac Jones' girlfriend, Sophie, post on TikTok?</h2><p>In addition to content about Mac, including a post that was a compilation from a football game, Sophie also posts plenty of videos of her dog. Although she has a number of videos on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok page</a>, she seems to have stopped posting in August of this year. Sophie still posts frequently on Instagram, though, and has even developed a brand ambassadorship through her social media presence.&nbsp;</p><p>Sophie is currently working as a brand ambassador for Vestique online fashion and has also modeled clothes from a number of other fashion lines. Sophie and Mac are still relatively young, but they have been dating for more than a year now. They went Instagram official in September of 2019, and celebrated their one-year anniversary a year later with a post captioned â€œOne year with you @macjones_10."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sophie Scott also posts regularly on Facebook.</h2><p>In addition to her presence on Instagram and <a href=#>TikTok</a>, Sophie also posts updates to her Facebook page. Judging from those, it seems that Sophie has a promising future ahead of her regardless of how her boyfriend's pro football prospects pan out. Sophie announced in 2020 that she had been named a finalist for an internship in orthopedic clinical research at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colo.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@sophiescott999 href=#>@sophiescott999</a><p>Bama has the best game days ðŸ¤© @macjones <a title=football href=#>##football</a> <a title=alabama href=#>##alabama</a> <a title=fashionedit href=#>##FashionEdit</a> <a title=college href=#>##college</a> <a title=collegelife href=#>##collegelife</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##Fyp</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##FYP</a></p><a title="â™¬ Run free - Deep Chills feat.

IVIE</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>That internship was ultimately canceled because of COVID-19, but it seems that Sophie's interest in research and medicine are likely to propel her to a successful career. In a post announcing the cancellation of the internship, Sophie kept things in perspective. â€œI feel for all of the college students who are missing out on opportunities similar to mine, but I am grateful for my health at this time and looking forward to applying again next summer," she wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Mac is definitely a prominent presence on Sophie's Instagram feed, she is not the only person she photographs. In addition to going to football games, Sophie appears to enjoy modeling, spending time at the beach, and hanging out with girlfriends.</p><p>Mac may have helped Alabama finish their season with yet another championship, but he's also found a girlfriend who has plenty of other things going on. They're both still young, but the fact that they respect one another's personal interests suggests that they've found a healthy way to balance their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6kecmopZ6rXZy2s7jFq6CeppRiwaq306ii</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmac-jones-girlfriend-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmac-jones-girlfriend-tiktok.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmac-jones-girlfriend-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmac-jones-girlfriend-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmac-jones-girlfriend-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmac-jones-girlfriend-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./horse-girl-netflix.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./horse-girl-netflix.html>Netflix's 'Horse Girl' Is Really About More Than Just Horses</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./howard-keel-html.html>Howard Keel - Trivia, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./howard-keel-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
