A roundup of the doctor's best moments.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>It's been more than nine years after the series finale of <a href=#>Scrubs</a> aired, and there simply hasn't been a comedy like it on air since. The medical comedy starred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zach Braff</a> as smart aleck J.D., who works at Sacred Heart Hospital with his eventual wife, Elliott Reid (Sarah Chalke) and his best friend Christopher "Turk" (Donald Faison), and Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes) among a cast of other quirky and hilarious characters.</p><h2>These are the most charming Scrubs Christmas episodes featuring J.D.</h2><p>Though J.D. is definitely the show's lovable-but-pessimistic narrator, he also showcases his charming and sweet side, especially around the holidays. These <a href=#>five charming J.D. moments from each Scrubs Christmas episode</a> will have you saying "Bah Humbug" to your responsibilities so you can re-watch them all.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. 1. My Own Personal Jesus (Season 1, Episode 11)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>In "My Personal Jesus," J.D. has arguably his worst day yet at Sacred Heart Hospital. After learning he has to film a birth for Dr. Cox's personal friend, he then has to tell a patient's family that the patient will die.&nbsp;</p><p>While he's breaking the news, the patient wakes up after a whopping two weeks of being in a coma, which Turk declares a miracle. In his narration, J.D. admits that he admires Turk for having the faith to believe it was a miracle.&nbsp;</p><p>After Turk's night shift on Christmas Eve, he declares that he's faithless. But, his faith returns when a guiding light leads him to a woman in the throes of giving birth outside.&nbsp;</p><p>When discussing babies in his narration, J.D. has his charming moment.&nbsp;</p><p>He says, "I think it's impossible to be unaffected. Because a baby can stir something deep down inside you that you didn't even know was there. It can help you find something you thought you'd lost. So I guess Turk was right after all. Miracles do happen. I think you just have to be willing to look for them. "</p><p>In a less charming J.D. moment, this is also the episode when he keeps blurting out "banana hammock" as a way to break the awkward tension in conversations.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. 2. My Monster (Season 2, Episode 10)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>In this episode, Turk and Carla remind J.D. of the dry spell he's going through, he decides to take a chance and ask Lisa the Gift Shop Girl (Sarah Lancaster) out on a date. When the two are about to kiss, J.D. can only envision the gross ailments his patients have.</p><p>After getting cut off from her dad and running out of time on her lease, Elliott is homeless too. When J.D. learns that Elliott has been staying in a moving van, he pleads for her to stay with him.</p><p>"I know you want to show everyone you can stand on your own two feet, but you don't have to prove anything to me," J.D. tells her in a swoon-worthy moment. "Come stay with me and Turk."</p><p>J.D.'s *other* problem is then solved when he and Elliot get together once again at the end of the episode.&nbsp;</p><p>"Merry Christmas," Elliott says to J.D. after the two reconcile.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is exactly what I wanted," he responds.&nbsp;</p><p>This episode was just one of the countless reasons why fans couldn't wait for Elliot and J.D. to be an official couple, and it hinted at how sweet J.D. would be with her down the road.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. 3. My Rule of Thumb (Season 3, Episode 10)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>J.D. gets quite the Christmas gift in Season 3 when his girlfriend Danni (Tara Reid) asks to move in with him. She had caught Dr. Cox in the act with her sister, Jordan (Christa Miller) and wanted to live anywhere but there. He agrees, which is surprisingly mature for the commitment-phobe.</p><p>At the same time, Elliot and Carla are trying to give the gift of a gigolo to one of their terminally ill patients. When Danni admits that she knows a lot of strippers, J.D. freaks out even more about her moving in.&nbsp;</p><p>The terminally ill patient ends up hooking up with her lawyer, who had toyed with jumping off the roof of the hospital earlier in the episode. In a strange, strange way, this episode does actually bring the holiday spirit.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. 4. My Best Moment (Season 4, Episode 12)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>If we had to pick our favorite Christmas Scrubs episode, it would be this one. We'd be lying if we said we didn't need a tissue box after watching this emotional episode.</p><p>When J.D. is assigned to talk to pre-med students about going into medicine, he instead goes off on a tangent about the best moments he's had as a doctor. He tells them about sleeping with a hot grandma after he helped her daughter give birth.</p><p>Later, when a 10-year-old boy's father is admitted to the ICU, J.D. promises that he'll be okay. Dr. Cox scolds J.D. for making a promise he can't necessarily keep, and he even says he's not a great doctor for doing so. When the father goes in for surgery, the staff is on edge, waiting to find out what happens. When the man survives the surgery (which is done by Turk), J.D. is visibly relieved. It's not often that we see J.D. let his guard down, and it was heartwarming to see him so concerned about a kid.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the episode, Dr. Cox lets J.D. check on the boy's father alone, which showed that he had faith in his abilities as a doctor. The episode is one of the most feel-good of all, and it really embodies holiday cheer.&nbsp;</p><p>"I kept my promise, because the two of them made it home in time for Christmas. And that was my best moment in medicine," he says. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. 5. My Coffee (Season 6, Episode 3)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>OK, so this isn't exactly a Christmas episode per se. But, the episode did air right before Christmas in 2006, and it does center around a Coffee Bucks (which is obviously making fun of Starbucks, aka the king of holiday drinks) opening at the hospital. Dr. Cox points out the weirdness of having a coffee place in a hospital, by saying that it will likely lead to an ice cream store at a morgue. That quip alone makes the episode worth watching.</p><p>After welcoming daughter Isabella, Turk starts to struggle with the fact that he's a father. He worries about providing for his family after Carla questions going back to work. Meanwhile, J.D.'s girlfriend, Kim (Elizabeth Banks) is also pregnant, and he's not even sure if he likes her.&nbsp;</p><p>J.D. finally hits a new level of maturity in this episode, when he tells Turk that he'll be okay no matter what, and that he will always be able to provide for his family. Though J.D. is definitely charming with the ladies, his most poignant moments are really with Turk.</p><p>While we wish that there were more Christmas-themed Scrubs episodes, we&nbsp;understand that even some doctors have off for the holiday. All nine seasons of Scrubs are available to stream on Hulu.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7Fuv8KrrJurXZi1s7XSraSaq12avaq%2Fzp2crA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjd-scrubs-christmas-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjd-scrubs-christmas-episodes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjd-scrubs-christmas-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjd-scrubs-christmas-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjd-scrubs-christmas-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjd-scrubs-christmas-episodes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tinubu-has-shown-that-it-is-not-business-as-usual-group-reacts-to-nsipa-boss-suspension.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tinubu-has-shown-that-it-is-not-business-as-usual-group-reacts-to-nsipa-boss-suspension.html>Tinubu Has Shown That It Is Not Business As Usual</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hyacinth-aondona-dajoh.html>Read All The Latest News About Hyacinth Aondona Dajoh On Naija News</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hyacinth-aondona-dajoh.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
