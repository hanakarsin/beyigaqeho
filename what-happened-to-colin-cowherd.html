The sports commentator and co-host of The Herd with Colin Cowherd has had a healthy share of controversial moments with athletes and fans alike. And while Colin does have his own unique perspective on sports news and other stories, he has gained quite the following over the years.</p><p>And now, Colin has found himself in the headlines yet again, but not for his opinions on sports. After news spread that he was hospitalized Super Bowl 55 weekend, many questions arose as to what exactly happened to the star. Here’s everything we know.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, what exactly happened that landed Colin Cowherd in the hospital?</h2><p>Since we're all in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, it's easy to believe that someone being hospitalized has something to do with the virus. However, it doesn't look like Colin has fallen victim to it. In fact, his trip to the hospital was caused by a different health complication.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>In an Instagram video, Colin went into detail about why he was hospitalized and noticeably absent from The Herd with Colin Cowherd on Monday and Tuesday. "Saturday night, I was having dinner with my wife and I had a sharp pain under my right peck," he shares with fans. "It was the most pain I’ve ever been in."</p><p>He went on to share that he rushed to the hospital after consulting with a friend. "From there —thinking it was COVID-19 — I was rushed to the emergency room," he continued.</p><p>"I was tested for COVID-19 and it wasn't COVID-19," he shares. “They found, through the X-rays, that I had a small blood clot in my right lung. It was limiting my breathing. Again, it was scary. Good news, they tested me again for COVID-19 and I didn’t have it. I’m waiting for some blood work. I have no idea why it happened.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Colin Cowherd (@colincowherd)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will Colin return to 'The Herd with Colin Cowherd' anytime soon?</h2><p>We can all agree it's great news that Colin has not tested positive for COVID-19, but there is something going on with the state of his health. And while a negative result does give the star grounds to return to work, he's taking some time off.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spun</a>, Colin is on temporary leave from the show. While there is no indicator of when he will be back on air, his health should be his priority.</p><p>And since blood clots can be caused by a number of different issues, it's important that he takes the time to find answers and come back stronger.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>And fans of Colin are standing behind him. After the news spread via social media, fans and supporters alike have been sending the sports star well wishes.</p><p>From Charles Barkley to his co-host, Joy Taylor, people have been sending him endless support. In fact, some fans have even questioned if he has actually had COVID-19 in the past.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Random Blood Clots During a Pandemic from a bizarre Virus that causes blood clots isn't a coincidence.
