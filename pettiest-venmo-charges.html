If you're not familiar with it, Venmo is an app that makes it easy to send money to people from your bank account, and it can come in handy when splitting bills or making utility payments to your roommates. But anyone who knows your handle can send you a request for cash‚Äîwhich you can also refuse. There's also a social media element, so if you don't set those requests to private, anyone you're connected with can see all the back-and-forth drama over toilet paper, or whatever. The potential for drama is there, because drama follows humanity from app to app.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What is the most unreasonable Venmo request you or a friend has ever received?
