The series follows the life of <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a> herself, from her father's untimely death to now, and the third season is set to air soon.&nbsp;</p><p>But what is it like to have your whole life played out on television and be alive for it? Well, just ask the queen, who's actually watched the show.</p><p>Yes, that's right — Queen Elizabeth has actually sat down and watched The Crown. We can't imagine what that experience must be like, especially because this whole series is being produced and she's not in on any of the production, meaning she doesn't know how they're going to portray her until the season airs.</p><p>So, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what does the matriarch of the royal family think of The Crown?</a></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What does the queen think of The Crown? Apparently, she likes it!</h2><p>While no one has asked Queen Elizabeth directly, a variety of sources within the royal family have revealed that she enjoys sitting down to watch the show.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Express</a>, a source revealed that the family has some royal movie nights together, and she was eventually persuaded by her son, Prince Edward, to watch it.&nbsp;</p><p>“It has been a longstanding arrangement that they drive to Windsor at the weekend to join the Queen for an informal supper while watching TV or a film," the source told the Daily Express. "They have a Netflix account and urged her to watch it with them. Happily, she really liked it, although obviously there were some depictions of events that she found too heavily dramatised."</p><p>That sounds like at least a four-star review from the queen — which is impressive, since she lived through the events herself.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Not everyone in the royal family loves the show.</h2><p>While Queen Elizabeth may have given it her own stamp of approval, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bustle</a> reveals that not everyone in the royal family is thrilled that the show is being produced.</p><p>Matt Smith, who played Prince Phillip in the first two seasons of the show, revealed that a close friend of his asked Philip himself if he was a fan. Somehow he got seated next to the Duke at dinner, and what better question to ask him than his opinion on the show.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>His short answer: No. He's really not a fan.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Matt, Prince Phillip's exact words were "Don't. Be. Ridiculous." Yikes.&nbsp;</p><p>We don't blame him for being a little standoffish about the show, but it also could be because Season 2 hints that he had an extramarital affair. Watching your family's personal matters dramatized on television doesn't give you a warm, fuzzy feeling, either, and honestly, a lot of monarchs probably wouldn't like their lives put out for the public to see like that.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Season 3 hits Netflix Nov. 17.</h2><p>If you've been wondering when the next installment will hit screens, don't worry, because you'll get your historical-reenactment fix soon. The third season is set to drop on Netflix on Nov. 17, marking the halfway point to the series. The Crown is set to have six seasons in total, with new cast members every season to depict a new era in Queen Elizabeth's life. In total, there will be 60 episodes.</p><p>If the queen is behind, it might be time for her to binge-watch the last season.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXam1pnnQrpyepl2ptaq6ymamn2WknbJur9Gorqc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-the-queen-think-of-the-crown.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-does-the-queen-think-of-the-crown.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-the-queen-think-of-the-crown.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-does-the-queen-think-of-the-crown.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-the-queen-think-of-the-crown.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-the-queen-think-of-the-crown.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happens-if-you-lie-under-oath.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happens-if-you-lie-under-oath.html>What Happens If You Lie Under Oath?
