The Canadian singer-songwriter passed away at 84 years old, and many are wondering how he died.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It’s always tragic when another star is lost, and on May 1, 2023, we lost Canadian singer-songwriter, <a href=#>Gordon Lightfoot</a>. He was a folk-rock icon to many, known most for his 1971 hit, “If You Could Read My Mind.” He may not have the same household recognition as his contemporaries, but his catalog of over 400 songs changed music.</p><p>Throughout his life, Gordon struggled with alcoholism and addiction, and in 2002, he was struck with various health issues. He continued to write and record music, and we were blessed with his presence until he passed away at 84 years old at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Canada. But what was Gordon Lightfoot’s cause of death?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gordon Lightfoot’s cause of death was natural causes.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gordon’s Facebook page</a> posted an official statement around 9:30 p.m. on May 1, 2023. “It is with profound sadness that we confirm that Gordon Meredith Lightfoot has passed away,” it said. “Gordon died peacefully on Monday, May 1, 2023, at 7:30 p.m. at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto. He died of natural causes. He was 84 years old. He is survived by his wife Kim Hasse, six children—Fred, Ingrid, Eric, Galen, Miles, and Meredith, as well as several grandchildren.”</p><p>Although he became sober in 1982, Gordon had health struggles later in life. In 2002, just before the second concert of a two-night stint in Orillia, Canada, he needed emergency vascular surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The issues continued when he fell into a six-week coma, a tracheotomy, and four more operations.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2003, he had to get a follow-up surgery, but by 2004, he was performing once again. Nothing can stop a true artist from making art! However, in 2006, Gordon suffered from a minor stroke during a performance and lost the use of some fingers on his right hand, which naturally made it pretty hard to play guitar.</p><p>In 2016, at 77 years old, Gordon shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">City News Everywhere</a>, “At this age, my challenge is doing the best show I can. I’m very much improved from where I was and the seriousness with which I take it.” He was ready to go on a 2023 tour, but on April 11, 2023, he canceled the tour due to "health-related issues."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Various celebrities and fans have shared tributes following Gordon’s death.</h2><p>Since Gordon’s passing, several celebrities have taken to social media to share their condolences. Singer-songwriter Stephen Bishop commented on the official Facebook statement, “My condolences to his family, friends, and fans. A legend and a great songwriter.” Trey Hensley wrote another comment: “What a huge loss. Thanks for creating some of the greatest music ever, Gordon Lightfoot. Rest easy.”</p><p>Actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Stiller tweeted</a>, “What a genius #GordonLightfoot was. His music is such a big part of my life. Rest in peace. Grateful for the inspiration he gave all of us.” And writer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen King wrote</a>, “Gordon Lightfoot has died. He was a great songwriter and a wonderful performer. Sundown, you better take care/If I catch you creepin' 'round my back stairs.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Bryan Adams (@bryanadams)</a></p></figure><p>Even Canadian prime minister <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Trudeau tweeted</a>, “We have lost one of our greatest singer-songwriters.

May his music continue to inspire future generations, and may his legacy live on forever. To his family, friends, and many fans across the country and around the world: I’m keeping you in my thoughts at this difficult time.”</p><p>The ripples of Gordon’s death will be felt throughout the world.</p><p>Our condolences go out to Gordon’s fans, friends, and family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLyzsM6nZKWhl53Bp7vOrWScmaWosm67xWabnpmknQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgordon-lightfoot-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgordon-lightfoot-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgordon-lightfoot-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgordon-lightfoot-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgordon-lightfoot-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgordon-lightfoot-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cosmo-jost-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cosmo-jost-html.html>Cosmo Jost - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1201569-yvonne-nelsons-biography-interesting-facts-know-html.html>Yvonne Nelson's biography: Interesting facts to know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1201569-yvonne-nelsons-biography-interesting-facts-know-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
