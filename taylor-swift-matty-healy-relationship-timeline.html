The musicians have been friends for years, both collaborate with producer Jack Antonoff, and they briefly faced romance rumors all the way back in 2014. But the announcement of <a href=#>Taylor and Joe Alwyn'</a>s breakup after six years of dating just happened. Could T-Swift really have moved on that quickly?</p><p>Let's take a closer look at Taylor and Matty's relationship timeline.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taylor Swift and Matty Healy's relationship timeline began in 2014.</h2><p>Taylor and Matty were first romantically linked back in 2014.</p><p>In November of that year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matty wore a T-Shirt featuring Taylor's "1989" album</a> during a The 1975 concert in Milwaukee, Wis. Taylor was spotted mere days later at a The 1975 concert in Los Angeles with her friends, Selena Gomez and Ellie Goulding.</p><p>Not long afterward, the "Blank Space" singer was photographed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sporting a tank top with the British alternative band's name</a> on it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Matty Healy and Taylor Swift in 2014</p></figure><p>During an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Australia’s Shazam Top 20</a>, Matty confirmed that he met Taylor, along with a handful of other celebrities, at his band's LA concert.</p><p style=text-align:start>"We exchanged numbers. Let's see what happens," Matty said when the host predicted he and Taylor would be the next big item. “I mean, bloody hell, what am I going to do, go out with Taylor Swift? She’s a sensation. I wouldn’t say no.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>In December 2014, Taylor attended a second The 1975 concert with <a href=#>former BFF Karlie Kloss</a> in New York City. (That's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">where the infamous "kissgate" reportedly happened.)</a> This sparked further dating rumors.</p><p>Also in December of that year, a video circulated of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matty and Taylor making a personal message</a> for someone named Kitty. (She's the daughter of The 1975's record label, Jamie Oborne, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>.)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@h0meboy1 href=#>@h0meboy1</a><p>“Hi Kitty” <a title=taylorswift href=#>#taylorswift</a> <a title=swiftie href=#>#swiftie</a> <a title=swifties href=#>#swifties</a> <a title=mattyhealy href=#>#mattyhealy</a> <a title=the1975 href=#>#the1975</a> <a title=taylorswiftnews href=#>#taylorswiftnews</a></p><a title="♬ BILLIE EILISH. - Armani White" href=#>♬ BILLIE EILISH. - Armani White</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Early 2015: Matty Healy denied Taylor Swift relationship rumors.</h2><p style=text-align:start><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a January 2015 interview</a> with Shazam Top 20, Matty clarified the Taylor dating rumors were unfounded. “It is bloody fake.

I am NOT being Taylor Swift’s boyfriend.’ You know, ‘F---. THAT. That’s also a man thing, a de-masculinating, emasculating thing.”</p><p>That same year, Matty tweeted his praises for Taylor. “I have said on countless occasions that I found her to be one of the most gracious, hard working, creatively gifted, and beautiful women that I have had the pleasure to meet," he wrote at the time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per Elle</a>. "I personally have a lot of respect and admiration for her. Why would I not?”</p><p>Matty also tweeted about his frustration over the constant questions about reportedly dating Taylor. He wrote: “I didn't even date Taylor, but the media's incessant and brutal obsession with her has meant that even a guy who DIDN'T DATE HER has been so battered by their never-ending questions that he's inevitably said something that can be lifted and molded into something that resembles ‘shade.’ It's really sad.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>what i’m hearing is that taylor swift ft the 1975 exists but i’ll never get to hear it <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/t9n92Sy6BB</a></p>— may ♡ (@strghtoutamag) <a href=#>November 29, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matty and Taylor reportedly collaborated for "Midnights," but the song didn't make the final cut.</h2><p>During an interview with Kroq’s <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">DTS Sound Space</a> about the release of The 1975's album, "Being Funny in a Foreign Language," Matty confirmed that Taylor listened to "bits of it" before it was released through music producer Jack Antonoff (who works with both the band and T-Swift). The 1975 frontman also revealed his band heard portions of "Midnights" before its release.</p><p>"Yeah, yeah. We actually worked a bit on that but then the version of it never came out," he said.</p><p>When folks booed, Matty immediately shut them down. "No, no, no, no, no, no, that's not how it works.
