At the same time, they revealed that they were having a boy.</p><p>Naturally, in the months leading up to the baby's due date, the ACE Family continued putting out content and teasing the birth details to their fans.&nbsp;</p><p>The baby was born on June 20, and Austin and Catherine posted several videos about the delivery before they revealed what his name would be.</p><p>What is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ACE Family's newest baby's name?</a> Keep reading to find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the ACE Family's baby name?</h2><p>The ACE Family generally films every day (and posts every few days), but they switched up their schedule following the birth of Baby #3. In their birth vlog series, Catherine and Austin discussed going to the hospital, the labor process, and how the girls reacted to meeting their little brother. But, they noticeably kept their little one's name to themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>More than a week after their son was born, Austin and Catherine finally announced that they named their boy Steel McBroom in "BABY NAME REVEAL!!! **IS THE ACE FAMILY NAME CHANGING?**" which they posted on July 2.&nbsp;</p><p>Though their names have all started with one of the letters in the word "ACE," Catherine and Austin veered from their tradition for their son. But, they justified this change by explaining that they referred to themselves as aces, and that the "s" now stood for Steel.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Catherine and Austin explained how they chose the name Steel.</h2><p>Before they actually revealed the baby's name, the pair discussed their initial struggle to settle on a boy name.&nbsp;</p><p>"I feel like his name is very significant to me in a lot of different ways, and I want to share that with you guys. When I was pregnant with Elle five years ago, we obviously didn't know if we were having a boy or a girl. I always knew if I had a daughter, I would name her Elle ... for a boy, it was kind of hard to pick a name," Catherine said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>As a father I couldn‚Äôt ask for anything more ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Austin McBroom</a> (@austinmcbroom) on Jun 26, 2020 at 1:39pm PDT</p></figure><p>She explained that the name first came to her when she was pregnant with four-year-old daughter Elle.&nbsp;</p><p>"There was a certain occasion where Austin was actually playing basketball in another city. I was home alone a lot during that time. It just came to me one day. The name just came to me, it was so random. It didn't really mean anything at the time, at all. It's kind of an uncommon name, and kind of, in a way, odd. But, I told Austin and he liked it."&nbsp;</p><p>The couple then explained that they had encountered a psychic, who told them that they would go through a hard time (which may have been in reference to the drama when Cole Carrigan accused Austin of cheating), but that they would soon welcome a son.&nbsp;</p><p>Austin also commissioned someone to write Catherine a poem, and their son's name was included in it. They read the poem aloud for their viewers.</p><p>"I don't know if you guys are going to like it or not. I love his name ... something about him in particular, I feel so much power," Catherine said about her son's moniker.&nbsp;</p><p>"It reminds me of superheros," Austin said. "It's so strong."</p><p>The baby already has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram page</a> with more than 300,000 followers. They did not reveal if their son would have a middle name.</p><p>You can watch The ACE Family baby name announcement below!</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrCmecWapKKkqWKvoq7YZqWapZU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2face-family-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2face-family-baby-name.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2face-family-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2face-family-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2face-family-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2face-family-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-the-fox-masked-singer-clues.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-the-fox-masked-singer-clues.html>Every Clue We Have on the Fox's Identity on 'The Masked Singer'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./367483-ngome-ya-kisiasa-ya-rais-uhuru-kenyatta-yaendelea-kupasuka-html.html>Ngome ya kisiasa ya Rais Uhuru Kenyatta yaendelea kupasuka</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./367483-ngome-ya-kisiasa-ya-rais-uhuru-kenyatta-yaendelea-kupasuka-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
