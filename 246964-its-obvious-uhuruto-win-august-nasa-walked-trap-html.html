I hold political matters very close to my heart and this one strategy by the National Super Alliance was disgraceful to it's bits.</p><p class=align-left>I have always said, wisdom is wealthier than knowledge and honesty is the weapon of progress. We lost it and that's a fact. Before the first Presidential debate was cancelled due to non -commitment by both parties, I had personally warned that it would be a bad strategy for NASA to play into Jubilee habits by avoiding the debate.</p><p class=align-left>For one, Jubilee knows they've advantage of incumbency, and no doubt they still have advantage of numbers, but which could not guarantee them a clear 50+1 victory. By avoiding the debate they knew definitely NASA would play into their card- reason, they simply needed to deny NASA the golden opportunity to influence the minds of the many undecided voters who are critical.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Raila returns to Homa Bay and 'destroys' everything Uhuru did days ago</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0fgjhs4pqou12jc4t.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Tension as retired president's health worsens after operation</p><p class=align-left>Secondly, the platform could have been a difficult one for Jubilee since the questions asked would be based on their already much tainted legacy, Kalonzo Musoka would, therefore, have at one occasion or the other, been able to move a thousands of minds who currently support both NASA and Jubilee with a loose faith- (vulnerable).</p><p class=align-left>This was a magic opportunity for NASA to do position branding, in the absence of Jubilee to sweep the middle class votes, both undecided and other vulnerable Jubilee voters. Again this debate had nothing to do with deep faith supporters of the different affiliates, but it had everything to do with undecided voters and those vulnerable ones.</p><p class=align-left>A debating stage would have disadvantaged Jubilee and awarded NASA a lot of prevailing opportunities- Jubilee was well advised about it. Thus they pulled out of the debate knowing very well they would derail NASA to equally pull out.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Controversial photo of Jubilee CS launching 'elderly persons'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs7sjct4fcpvk.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Pastor who allegedly has 33 girlfriends exposed by one of them</p><p class=align-left>Now, one cannot use the excuse of unbiased media, that's an illusion, most of our media outlets are private, meaning other than their media role, they're majorly business enterprises. Thus if Jubilee has paid up for it's adverts, NASA has not bothered. The reason GoK delivers runs is because they've paid up for those adverts.</p><p class=align-left>In any instance NASA, being serious about capturing power, needs to be easy to invest in the media too. You cannot only run rallies, fail to charge resources into the media and then complain of unfair coverage. While Kalonzo had an opportunity to defend his case,which he missed but the GoK delivery adverts continued to run.</p><p class=align-left>Lastly, these debates should never be discredited, they are important to the voters. Many a times, these public rallies are stages where politicians simply story tell, insult one another, spread propaganda, deceits, and plant tribal animosity.</p><p class=align-left>Install TUKO App To Read News For FREE</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs3k113hoejqp.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Was Tanya's friend O.J of Tahidi High spotted coming from a cheap ‘Kumi Kumi’ spot? (Photos)</p><p class=align-left>It's these debates that provide for an opportunity to screen the credibility and authenticity of our leaders through an issue-based interrogation. We are not supposed to just support candidates for sake of it, elections are divine and must be treated as such.</p><p class=align-left>NASA team, honesty will progress us, but living in denial of the fact that we made a blunder is injecting false hope in our aspirations to take over leadership of this country. Once again, this debate was not about you, an informed NASA supporter, it was about getting new numbers on board. Remember we are not just competing, we're competing to win with numbers.</p><p class=align-left>It was breaking at a critical point, I won't be ashamed to admit, Kalonzo Musyoka is more eloquent that Raila Odinga.. He would have handled Deputy President William Ruto much better because I don't doubt President Uhuru will humiliate Raila in speech should he decide to attend the Presidential Debate of 24th.</p><p class=align-left>We lost the opportunity to get the winning vote, and we've lost the election itself.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Ian Asuga is the owner and Director at Dynepic Company Limited and also works at Khamati Minishi and Co Advocates.
