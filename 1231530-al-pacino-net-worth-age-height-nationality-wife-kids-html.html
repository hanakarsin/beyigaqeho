His acting is highly talented and inspiring. It, like his films, will live forever.</p><h3>Al Pacino net worth, life and career</h3><p class=align-left>Alfredo James Pacino <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was born </a>on April 25, 1940, in the South Bronx, New York, USA. Pacino`s grandfather and grandmother came from Corleone (Sicily). The father Salvatore Alfio and the mother Rose Gerard got married in 1939, and in 1942, when their son was only two years old, they divorced. You will probably ask "<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">What nationality</a> is Al Pacino?" He is an American born to Italian-American parents.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73bb92e02cbf2336.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A quick look at the amazing life of Patrick Duffy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At 17, he was expelled from the High School of Performing Arts, but continued to study acting, first at the Herbert Berghof Studio, and then at the famous Actors Studio (led by the American actor and director Lee Strasberg), where Pacino played in non-Broadway performances.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Harrison Ford net worth, age, height, wife and children</p><p class=align-left>In 1972, director Francis Coppola invited the little-known theatrical actor to one of the two leading roles in the film <i>The Godfather</i>. The shooting showed that a short, dark-eyed and haired, typical Italian is not only talented but also extremely goal-oriented and obsessed with work. His natural restraint unexpectedly gave way to violent outbursts of temperament in key scenes, which made the film poignant and unpredictable. All this immediately put forward Pacino in the first row of masters of American cinema.</p><p class=align-left>There were many years of hard work before. Although honorary awards marked many of his roles in that period, the stage activity did not bring the actor any fame or wealth.
