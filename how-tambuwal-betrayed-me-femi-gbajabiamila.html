For example, when there were attempts by the then executive arm to remove Tambuwal, following his defection to the APC, Gbajabiamila, along with like-minded, had to scale the National Assembly gate to access the House chamber to forestall the plot.</p><p>“Coming to 2015, with all the sacrifices that Gbajabiamila made for Tambuwal, it was taken for granted that the (now) Sokoto State governor would support him to emerge Speaker. But the outgoing Speaker had another plan – to have Dogara succeed him.”</p><p>Gbajabiamila giving an insight into how the Sokoto State Governor betrayed him said, “When the time came for the speakership election, it was taken for granted.</p><p>“I didn’t even lose any sleep over who Tambuwal was supporting; he had become widely popular in the House at the time.</p><p>“He was close to my family. So, we were surprised when we started hearing little things here and there. Even when I started hearing that he was supporting someone else, I thought it was not true, until I found out that it was true. He never told me. Even when I asked him, he said it was impossible. Such was the height of treachery.</p><p>“Don’t forget that beyond speakership, there were about seven to eight of us that started the Tambuwal project for president, and came very close to clinching the ticket. We supported him fully. We met every night till 2, 3, 4 in the morning.”</p><p>The Speaker also accused Tambuwal of stopping his move to becoming House leader after being defeated by Dogara.</p><p>He noted that when it was time to run for speaker again, former governor of Zamfara State, Yari and Tambuwal reached out to him to drop his deputy, Monguno for Dogara.</p><p>Gbajabiamila said he rejected the move as he asked them to meet with Monguno if he would step down for Dogara.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5BsZqGnp2LBornBrq6apF2XsrW%2BwLKcnWWdmnqnscyiZKCakZ%2Buo7XApqClmV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-tambuwal-betrayed-me-femi-gbajabiamila.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-tambuwal-betrayed-me-femi-gbajabiamila.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-tambuwal-betrayed-me-femi-gbajabiamila.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-tambuwal-betrayed-me-femi-gbajabiamila.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-tambuwal-betrayed-me-femi-gbajabiamila.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-tambuwal-betrayed-me-femi-gbajabiamila.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nolan-bushnell-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nolan-bushnell-html.html>Nolan Bushnell - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./apc-presidential-campaign-council-can-change-timetable-anytime-keyamo.html>APC Presidential Campaign Council Can Change Timetable Anytime</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./apc-presidential-campaign-council-can-change-timetable-anytime-keyamo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
