Who is the Fox? All of 'The Masked Singer' clues.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Season 2 of <a href=#>The Masked Singer </a>is well underway, and a good portion of the singers have already been <a href=#>unmasked</a>. But one character who has yet to be unmasked is the <a href=#>Fox</a>. His performance of Panic!'s "Hey Look Ma I Made It" had fans enthralled — and we need to know which celebrity is behind that mask.</p><p>So <a href=#>who really is the man behind the Fox?</a> Here are all of the <a href=#>clues</a> we have on his identity.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is the Fox on The Masked Singer? Superheroes and comic books play a big part in his clues.&nbsp;</h2><p>In most of the clue videos about the Fox, there's almost always the reference to superheroes. "There's my on-air superhero persona, who lives to entertain," he says in his clue video. There's consistent comic book imagery throughout this one, leading many to point fingers at characters like Jeremy Renner, who plays Hawkeye in the Avengers movies.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He has "dabbled in many different genres."</h2><p>Another big clue is that this character hasn't had one set path in his career, but has participated in many different genres in the entertainment industry. There's also the clue that he's "done [his] best work at night,” which could reference any late-night show or special.</p><p>This character's resume also likely includes work with Neil Patrick Harris and Robin Williams, indicated in the reference "from Doogie to Doubtfire." With this clue, viewers think that it might be Wayne Brady instead. Wayne played Neil's brother on How I Met Your Mother, and contributed to a couple of projects with Robin Williams before his death.&nbsp;</p><p>Probably the biggest indicator that the Fox is really Wayne is the clue, “I’ve won multiple awards and become a household name but I am mostly known for being part of a pack of talented fellas, not my voice alone." Wayne is best known for being a part of Whose Line Is It Anyway? which features a whole crew of comedians. This would also align with the "best work at night" clue, as comedy shows are usually at night.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">He also references having a tough upbringing.</h2><p>The Fox admits that he “grew up in a rough patch of the woods," and was also likely bullied for his voice. These clues give more background to his upbringing.&nbsp;</p><p>He also uses the term "shazam," which is a very specific term to use and could reference his real identity. This is the clue that has led some people to speculate that it's Jamie Foxx, which isn't a far-fetched idea.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So who is the Fox?</h2><p>The company US Bookies has some odds ready for who the real identity of the Fox is, and currently in the lead is Jamie Foxx with 5/1 odds. Behind him, the company has Black Panther alum Sterling K. Brown at 6/1 odds and former Boyz II Men member Shawn Stockman at 11/1.</p><p>Right now, we still think Wayne is more likely than Jamie, but we'll have to wait to see — stranger things have happened on this show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZK2glWKzsMSMppiso5WZerS1zaCcq2WTocKmvw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-the-fox-masked-singer-clues.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-the-fox-masked-singer-clues.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-the-fox-masked-singer-clues.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-the-fox-masked-singer-clues.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-the-fox-masked-singer-clues.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-fox-masked-singer-clues.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./gunmen-abduct-bayelsa-ssgs-mother.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./gunmen-abduct-bayelsa-ssgs-mother.html>Gunmen Abduct Bayelsa SSGs Mother</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ace-family-baby-name.html>The ACE Family Is Sharing All the Details of Baby No. 3 on YouTube</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ace-family-baby-name.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
