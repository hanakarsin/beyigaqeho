And that's exactly what Bryce was doing when he decided to ask the Amazon Alexa in his home for "help" with his math homework. Don't worry; his mom Leanne got the whole thing on tape.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video posted to Facebook</a>, mom Leanne Gormanley watches on surreptitiously in complete disbelief as her son Bryce askes Alexa for answer after answer to his math homework.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>"I would say it's a fantastic effort son...NOT," she wrote in the caption. "Alexa is NOT how you do your homework, Bryce. 10/10 for cleverness on this aul boy. Really could not believe the cheek of him doing it when I was in the vicinity."&nbsp;</p><p>The video has over 3 million views at this point because it is just so darn funny.&nbsp;</p><p>At the beginning of the video, you get the gist of what Bryce is doing and you see half of Leanne's shocked face taking it all in with the rest of us. "Alexa, eight multiplied by four," Bryce says, sitting on the floor with a pencil and his worksheet. Alexa gives him the answer, he writes it down, and then he very matter-of-factly moves on to the next problem.</p><p>It's priceless.</p><p>Eventually, Leanne chimes in and asks, "What is going on here?" And I cannot tell you how hard I laughed at Bryce's response. He turns around, sees that his mom caught him cheating and that she is filming the whole thing, and simply gives the biggest smile.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>"No," Leanne says, in total disbelief. "That is not how you do homework." But Bryce is on a mission, and I kid you not, as she's scolding him, Bryce turns back around and asks Alexa the next question. This kid! He really deserves an award or something, not only for his ingenious but his brazen lack of respect for his mom. Wow. He's a legend.</p><p>Poor mom Leanne couldn't help but laugh through the whole thing, and I don't blame her. Bryce may not ever be a math whiz, but he's already got the street smarts to cut corners and make it by any means necessary, and that's a valuable skill too.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure you watch the entire video below. It instantly became a timeless classic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The reactions to the video were priceless. Most people were just as impressed and you and I were at Bryce's ability to think his way out of a tough spot. "Well done, Bryce," one commenter wrote. "Got to give him credit for even doing that lol." Yes, yes you do have to give him credit. Because it's brilliant.</p><p>"Only using his initiative," another commenter wrote. "That's hilarious." Even Bryce's mom Leanne relented that she couldn't punish him for it. "I know and I really could not check him for that at all haha," she responded.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Well, it's settled. Bryce is a genius. He has brought joy and laughter to millions of people by cheating on his math homework, and that is way more than almost any other kid can say. While I hope that Bryce does someday learn his multiplication tables (it's really annoying how much they come in handy), for now, I think he's got it all figured out.</p><p>And as for Leanne? Well, she clearly has a hilarious kid on her hands who will have no trouble making it in the real world even if he never learns math because he's just that clever. So I don't think she has anything to worry about at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyuecKarKCgpGLAsLqMnJ%2BemaSeu6h5wKWcsZk%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmom-caught-son-cheating-alexa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmom-caught-son-cheating-alexa.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmom-caught-son-cheating-alexa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmom-caught-son-cheating-alexa.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmom-caught-son-cheating-alexa.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmom-caught-son-cheating-alexa.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nick-groff-biography-age-height-career-personal-life-heritage.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nick-groff-biography-age-height-career-personal-life-heritage.html>Nick Groff Biography, Age, Height, Career, Personal Life, History</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./are-prince-harry-and-meghan-related.html>Are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Actually Related?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./are-prince-harry-and-meghan-related.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
