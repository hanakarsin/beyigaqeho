If you've ever wanted to see Emry's clips yourself, it looks like he's holding lives on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok here</a>.</p><p>In Zebranate's video, they write the following in an overlay from one of Emry's live recordings:</p><p>"POV: You get fired by the police department so now you sit in your driveway in a uniform you ordered online cosplaying on TikTok with a target audience of divorced women in their 50s."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@zebranate href=#>@zebranate</a><p>How is he still at this?

He wanna be Agent Cody Banks so bad."</p><p>While that may seem like a harsh assessment of the clip, there were plenty of folks in the comments section who expressed how hard they were cringing upon seeing his behavior in the video.</p><p>In the 27-second snippet uploaded by Zebranate, Officer Emry can be seen posing and making facial expressions into the camera as he lip-syncs to a remix of "Kryptonite" by 3 Doors Down.</p><p>Numerous TikTokers were ragging on his get-up, with tons of folks lampooning his outfit, particularly the "plastic badge" on his vest. "What a strange thing to do," one person wrote.</p><p>Another made fun of his mannerisms in the video: "The holding the earpiece like he‚Äôs a part of the Backstreet Boys is so funny."</p><p>Someone else provided a bit more backstory on him: "He‚Äôs still not a real cop. He still does put a uniform on and record lives in his driveway. He really did get fired lol."</p><p>Another thought that their mother would probably get hoodwinked by his TikTok charms: "My mom would fall for this."</p><p>Officer Emry got called out by another TikTok user on the platform, @thesweetestdependa, who discussed the legalities of what the gentleman is doing online. Some folks thought that he was clearly impersonating a police officer. Others argued that since he's not attempting to abuse the false position of being a cop and since he's acting in a "cosplay" capacity, he's in the clear.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@Thesweetestdependa</a> gave her two cents on the situation, giving a bit more context on the man's backstory. She says that he used to be a police officer in South Carolina but "no longer is" because he "was forced to resign on allegations of fraud and a few other things."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@thesweetestdependa href=#>@thesweetestdependa</a><p>Replying to @LacieJ84 <a title=greenscreen href=#>#greenscreen</a> what is it isn‚Äôt illegal in this situation <a title=policeimpersonation href=#>#policeimpersonation</a> <a title=southcarolina href=#>#southcarolina</a> <a title=cop href=#>#cop</a> <a title=coptok href=#>#coptok</a> <a title=fakecop href=#>#fakecop</a> <a title=fraud href=#>#fraud</a> <a title=leo href=#>#LEO</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - thesweetestdependa" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - thesweetestdependa</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @thesweetestdependa</span></figure><p>She went on to say that he "still holds his certification until 2025," for being a police officer, which "means he is not a cop right now but if somebody hired him, he could go and be a cop," the TikToker explains.</p><p>The TikToker speculates that it'll be unlikely anybody is going to hire him, given the severity of the allegations levied against him. She then took the time to specifically address a comment penned by another TikToker, who insists that Emry is breaking the law by impersonating a police officer.</p><p>She goes on to state that impersonating in the state of South Carolina isn't a felony but rather a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Class C misdemeanor.</a></p><p>Then, she presents a screenshot of the definition of police impersonation in South Carolina, highlighting several key deciding factors that would find someone guilty of said crime.</p><p>The key factor, it appears, is the third deciding factor listed in the screenshot and it's "act[ing] upon that representation in any way."</p><p>So Emry would have to present themselves as a cop to a specific individual and then act upon these false pretenses.</p><p>@Sweetestdependa argues that because he's sitting in his driveway and going on TikTok live, he's not "acting upon that representation in any way."</p><p>If he left his driveway and cruised around, put on some red and blue flashing lights in his car, and pulled someone over, then he would totally be guilty of impersonating a police officer.</p><p>She adds, "What he's doing is fraud. That is illegal. However, it is not police impersonation because he's not out there, in a car, pulling people over, acting in a law enforcement capacity. Him wearing a Wish costume sitting in his car in his driveway on live for 90 hours a day doesn't mean he's impersonating a cop."</p><p>"It just means he's a weirdo," she says.</p><p>One user remarked that they, too, were baffled by so many folks who cried police impersonation upon seeing Officer Emry's clips, as they wrote: "Ur right on it! Like if that were the case, no one would be able to wear police costumes on Halloween or in TikTok skits lol."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZp2ho6m%2Foq%2FTop2yZpOkunC8jp%2BYpJ1dmLyxec6nZK2hm6m8rA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffake-cop-on-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffake-cop-on-tiktok.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffake-cop-on-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffake-cop-on-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffake-cop-on-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffake-cop-on-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-times-square-ball-drop-canceled.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-times-square-ball-drop-canceled.html>Is the New Year's Eve Times Square Ball Drop Canceled Because of COVID?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-tinubu-intervened-in-rivers-crisis-apc-chieftain.html>'Why Tinubu Intervened In Rivers Crisis'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-tinubu-intervened-in-rivers-crisis-apc-chieftain.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
